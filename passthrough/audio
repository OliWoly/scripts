To get audio working, follow steps 8.2:
  Passing audio from virtual machine to host via PipeWire directly

Add to xml like it says then change qemu conf to use the user.
  IMPORTANT: actually restart the daemon to change it lol.
    sudo systemctl restart libvirtd.service

Speakers should work through the nvidia audio drivers on windows now
